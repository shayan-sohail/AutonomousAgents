# AutonomousAgents

AutonomousAgents is a simulation project featuring programmable autonomous agents navigating a grid environment with walls, dirt, and charging stations. The primary goal of the agents is to collect as much dirt as possible while managing their battery levels by visiting charging stations when necessary.

## Features

- Simulates autonomous agents in a grid environment
- Agents navigate around walls and collect dirt
- Agents can recharge at charging stations
- Programmable number of agents with different behaviors
- Visualization of the grid, agents, dirt, walls, and charging stations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/shayan-sohail/AutonomousAgents.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd AutonomousAgents
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the simulation:
   ```sh
   python simulation.py
   ```
2. The simulation window will open, displaying the grid, agents, dirt, walls, and charging stations.
3. Agents will start navigating the grid, collecting dirt and recharging as needed.
